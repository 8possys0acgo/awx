## What is Ensoft Build Master Software Full Version?
 
Ensoft Build Master Software Full Version is a software package that includes several modules for different aspects of building design and analysis. These modules are:
 
- **Build-Master**: This module allows you to create 3D models of buildings and structures using a graphical user interface. You can also import and export data from other software such as AutoCAD, Revit, and STAAD.Pro.
- **LPILE**: This module allows you to analyze the behavior of piles under lateral loads. You can model different types of piles, soils, and load conditions, and obtain results such as pile deflections, bending moments, shear forces, and soil reactions.
- **GROUP**: This module allows you to analyze the behavior of pile groups under vertical and lateral loads. You can model different types of pile groups, soils, and load conditions, and obtain results such as group deflections, pile forces, group stiffnesses, and soil reactions.
- **APILE**: This module allows you to analyze the axial capacity of piles under various load conditions. You can model different types of piles, soils, and load cases, and obtain results such as pile capacities, load-displacement curves, settlement values, and soil resistances.
- **SHAFT**: This module allows you to analyze the behavior of drilled shafts under axial and lateral loads. You can model different types of shafts, soils, and load conditions, and obtain results such as shaft deflections, bending moments, shear forces, and soil reactions.
- **PYWall**: This module allows you to analyze the behavior of flexible retaining walls under lateral earth pressures. You can model different types of walls, soils, and load conditions, and obtain results such as wall deflections, bending moments, shear forces, earth pressures, and soil reactions.

All these modules are integrated in a single interface that allows you to easily switch between them and share data. You can also generate reports and graphs that summarize the results of your analysis.
